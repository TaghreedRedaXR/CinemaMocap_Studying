Installing Microsoft Kinect SDK

The Microsoft Kinect requires drivers and associated software to be loaded, so that other applications on your computer can take advantage of the features built into the product (such as Cinema Face Cap).  At this time, Microsoft requires you to download their full Microsoft Kinect SDK for this functionality.  Steps for installing the SDK are as follows:

1.	Download the Microsoft Kinect SDK at the following location:

	http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561

2.	Make sure your Kinect is UNPLUGGED FROM YOUR COMPUTER.  This is very important.  If this step is not done, the Kinect drivers MAY NOT properly 	install.

3.	Run the executable file downloaded in step 1 above.  The SDK process is a one button install, simply accept the license terms and click the install 	button.

4.	Click Close when prompted.  Note: you do not need to install the Developer Toolkit. However, if you would like to test functionality in Windows, the 	Developer Toolkit will allow you to do this.

5.	For install instructions from Microsoft, see the following link:
